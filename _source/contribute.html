## Call for Sponsors

We want to create the meeting space for open source communities in the Nordic region. The foss-north event is one step on that path. Nothing of this would be possible by the support of our sponsors.
 
We are looking for sponsors of all sizes to be a part of the foss-north event. We offer the following tiers: 

<div class="bodytext">

        <th>Base</th>
        <th>Silver</th>
        <th>Gold</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="leftalign">Cost</td>
        <td>10kSEK</td>
